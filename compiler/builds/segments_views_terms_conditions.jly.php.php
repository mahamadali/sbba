                <li>
                  <u>Paid Accounts</u>. For paid accounts (each, a “Paid Account”), Game Used Authority deems the person whose name appears on the credit or charge card or other payment method that pays the membership charges to be the owner of the Paid Account. If a corporate or other organization’s name appears on the credit or charge card or other payment method, that corporation or organization is deemed to be the owner. If any dispute arises as to who owns or controls a Paid Account, your most recently provided payment method will continue to be charged and you will be responsible to pay for the membership until Game Used Authority receives written confirmation from the Paid Account email address confirming a change in ownership and control of the Paid Account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <u>Fees and Renewals</u>. Pricing for Paid Accounts will be provided at the time of purchase. Unless otherwise set out at the time of purchase or as agreed to by Game Used Authority, membership fees for a Paid Account will be billed in advance for each Subscription Period (as defined below) and are non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service or for periods in which your Paid Account remains open but you do not use Game Used Web Platforms or your member benefits.
                  <br><br>
                  We reserve the right to modify our billing rates at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice by posting such fee changes on one or more of the Game Used Web Platforms or through email notification to you. You will be liable to pay such modified billing rates. 
                  <br><br>
                  Subject to your payment of applicable fees for a Paid Account, we will provide the purchased membership access to you for the period of time that you have paid for such service (the “Subscription Period”). At the end of the Subscription Period, your Paid Account subscription will automatically renew for an additional Subscription Period until it is expressly cancelled by you or us as described in the “Termination” section herein.
                  <br><br>
                  If you purchase any fee-based services (including, without limitation, a membership via a Paid Account) on the Game Used Web Platforms, you agree that our third party payment gateways may store your credit or charge card or other payment information. You expressly agree that we are authorized to charge you: (i) a fee for any applicable service for which you have subscribed, billed on a basis of the Subscription Period; (ii) any other fees for service you may purchase; (iii) any charges for use of the Service in excess of the usage or other limits placed on your use of the Service (and you hereby consent to such charges and agree we are not required to notify you of any such charge in advance); and (iv) any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Service to the credit or charge card you provide and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. If the credit or charge card you provide expires and you do not provide new credit or charge card information or cancel your account, you authorize us to continue billing you and you agree to remain responsible for any uncollected fees.
                  <br><br>

                  <u>User Materials</u>.
